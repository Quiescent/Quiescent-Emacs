* Introduction
This is the story of my Emacs configuration.  It's as much a story of
how I learned to program as it is a setup for Emacs -- the timeless
editor.

In this document you can expect to find:
 - how I configure Emacs;
 - the story of how I came to use particular parts of Emacs;
 - links to other Emacs Lisp sources where I've defined features to
   extend Emacs and the packages which I use;

The document begins by outlining the way in which it is expected to be
used.  Following this I detail the modifications I've made to it in
order to support he various environments on which I run it.  It then
details modifications which I've made to all programming modes.
Alterations and additions to specific modes follow this.  It then
moves into usages which don't relate to programming at all.  Another
section details modifications made to the appearance of Emacs.

The document concludes with some fluffy text about my configuration
and what I hope to achieve with it in the future.

* A Note on the Literate Nature of this Document
This document is literate and interactive.  It is, of course, best
viewed in Emacs itself.  Not only because it'll mark up all of the
code and headings correctly, but also because it'll provide
interactive development features.  You can edit the document and the
code contained directly, but it is recommended that you instead enter
code blocks with the =C-<single-quote>= binding.  Repeating that
binding will return you to the document proper.  While in this mode
you can execute the code as one usually would.

While not editing a source code block using the =C-<single-quote>=
binding you can still execute the code block to alter the Lisp
environment.  This is done with the binding =C-c C-c=.

* Modifications to Support the Environment

This section details the modifications which I've made to Emacs in
order to support the different environments which I run it on.

I use a set of configurations which are specific to each machine which
I run Emacs on in order to optimise my work flows on each system.
This allows me to program quick tasks which help automate laborious
tasks on those machines and to integrate more tightly with each tool
set that I use.  I load the configurations and tasks outside of this
file and I don't committing those files to my Emacs configuration
repository.  In doing so the configuration can vary per platform.

There are also modifications which are the same for the same type of
platform.  i.e. I'll always have the =PATH= variable determined from
=bash= on Mac OS X.

** OS X
On OS X there's a very irritating interaction between Emacs and the
system path.  For some reason GUI applications aren't launched with
the same path as terminal applications.  In order to fix this you can
use a package (ofc!) which sets the =exec-path= (what Emacs considers
to be the path) in an Emacs session to the same value as it would be
in Bash.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref exec-path-from-shell :lexical t
  (use-package exec-path-from-shell
    :ensure t
    :init
    (when (not (or (equal system-type 'windows-nt)
                   (equal system-type 'gnu/linux)))
      (with-eval-after-load "exec-path-from-shell"
        (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))))
#+END_SRC

** Controlling the Proxy
Sometimes I need control over environment variables so that I can
control third party binaries which Emacs plugs into.  Configuring the
proxy and whether it's on or off is the first reason that I've needed
this feature.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref toggle-proxy :lexical t
  (defvar quiescent-http-proxy ""
    "The previous/current value of the http proxy variable.")

  (defvar quiescent-http-proxy-active ""
    "Whether the proxy ought to be active right now.")

  (defun quiescent-toggle-proxy ()
    "Remember the proxy and then toggle it on and off when called."
    (interactive)
    (when (and (not (boundp 'queiescent-http-proxy))
               (not (string-equal quiescent-http-proxy "")))
      (progn
        (message "First binding")
        (setq quiescent-http-proxy        (getenv "HTTP_PROXY"))
        (setq quiescent-http-proxy-active t)))
    (if quiescent-http-proxy-active
        (progn
          (message "Unsetting proxy")
          (setenv "HTTP_PROXY" "")
          (setq quiescent-http-proxy-active nil))
        (progn
          (message "Setting proxy")
          (setenv "HTTP_PROXY" quiescent-http-proxy)
          (setq quiescent-http-proxy-active t))))
#+END_SRC

** Changing the Keyboard Layout
I pair a lot at work and I need to be able to switch layouts when
Emacs is running as the window manager.  I've created a function to
switch layouts quickly.  The function makes use of the =setxkbmap=
command.  Usually I use =setxkbmap -layout "dvorak" -option
ctrl:nocaps= in my =.xinitrc= to make dvorak the layout when I boot
in.  A small modification is needed to be able to toggle between
layouts.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref change-keyboard-layouts :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-toggle-keyboard-layout ()
    "Toggle between US and Dvorak keyboard layouts."
    (interactive)
    (set-process-filter (start-process "*Check-Layout*"
                                       nil
                                       "setxkbmap"
                                       "-query")
                        #'quiescent-handle-keyboard-query))

  (defun quiescent-handle-keyboard-query (_ output)
    "Use the output to decide whether to change to QWERTY or Dvorak."
    (if (string-match-p "dvorak" output)
        (quiescent-switch-to-layout "us")
      (quiescent-switch-to-layout "dvorak")))

  (defun quiescent-switch-to-layout (layout)
    "Use setkbmap to change the keyboard layout to LAYOUT."
    (start-process "*Change-Layouts*"
                   nil
                   "setxkbmap" "-layout" layout "-option" "ctrl:nocaps"))
#+END_SRC

** Windows Bindings
The super key used to be a thing on old computers, especially those of
a "lispy" nature.  It's really handy because it lets you bind shorter
key bindings by using it the same way you would meta or control.  To
use it on Windows you need to tell Emacs to bypass Windows' usual
bindings.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref windows-super-key :lexical t
  (if running-windows
    (progn (setq w32-pass-lwindow-to-system nil)
           (setq w32-lwindow-modifier 'super)
           (message "System is running windows"))
    (message "System is *NIX :)"))
#+END_SRC

** System Specific Tasks
I like to define tasks which optimise my work flow on each computer I
use.  By their nature these tasks couple tightly with the machine on
which they're run, therefore they wont usually work across machines.
I store these commands in a folder [[~/.emacs.d/system-specific-tasks/system-specific-tasks.el][inside my EMACS directory.]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref system-specific-tasks :lexical t
  (let ((system-specific-tasks-file "~/.emacs.d/system-specific-tasks/system-specific-tasks.el"))
    (when (file-exists-p system-specific-tasks-file)
      (load-file system-specific-tasks-file)))
#+END_SRC

** System Specific Config
I've put system specific settings in their own folder, including mail
settings and variables which I use throughout my setup to determine
whether I'm running a particular OS (mostly just for windows) and
where emacs should start.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref system-specific-config :lexical t
  (use-package system-vars
    :load-path "~/.emacs.d/conf")

  (defconst mail-settings-path "~/.emacs.d/conf/mail-settings.el"
    "The path to my mail settings")

  (when (file-exists-p mail-settings-path)
    (load-file mail-settings-path))

#+END_SRC
In this section I'll detail the modes and modifications to programming
in Emacs which don't pertain to any single language and instead modify
the entire environment.  These modifications aren't listed in any
particular order and they include modifications to navigation and
similar commands which change the way that I move around my system
while programming.

Many people swear by their IDE/Editors capability to complete what
they were typing.  Usually this involves the use of some kind of drop
down box.  I find that these tools add robustness, but actually slow
your typing down, because you have to wait for the list to appear,
read it, and then select the option you wanted.

Aside from encouraging one not to learn what functions /actually do/
before using them, this also slows down your editing.  I've adopted
tools which instead allow me to quickly enter what I need to -- which
first requires that I know /what I should be entering/.

It's no use keeping your hands in the correct typing positions the
whole time if it takes an age to move the point to areas of the
screen.  If it takes ages to move about then you may as well take the
performance hit of using a mouse.  Well EMACS has some power tools
which help you move to just about any visible point in at most about
four key strokes and non visible points in a small (but not
predictable) amount of time.

The following two packages are about super fast navigation of the
point to visible portions of the screen.

** No Tab Characters in Code!
There's no guarantee on the way that tabs render in different editors,
when printed or when viewed on the Internet.  Spaces don't suffer from
this problem.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref no-tabs :lexical t
  (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
  (setq tab-width 4)
#+END_SRC

** Column Numbers
When I got going with C++ I was taught via the command line.  One of
the things which compilers reported to you back then and today and so
has become very important is which column an error occurs
on.  Confusingly, EMACS doesn't show column numbers by default.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref column-number-mode :lexical t
  (column-number-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

** Disabled Commands
Up and down casing a region is disabled by default (!?) This wont do!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref disabled-commands :lexical t
  (put 'upcase-region   'disabled nil)
  (put 'downcase-region 'disabled nil)
#+END_SRC

** Manipulating the Other Window
It's often useful to modify the other window without ever leaving this
window.  The following library contains, to begin with, functions for
moving the point about in the other window.  I'm thinking that this
library will end up being pretty big after a while.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref other-window :lexical t
  (require 'quiescent/other-window)
#+END_SRC

** Buffer Set Operations
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref buffer-set-operations :exports none :lexical t
  <<buffer-disjunction>>
  <<this-but-not-that>>
#+END_SRC
This is a section where I'm creating set like operations to work on
buffers.  The first one that I needed was disjunction -- to solve the
problem of which lines are not common to each buffer.  I needed to
check whether I had deleted files while restructuring a project.  Git
would have been able to tell me except that it definitely got confused
by some of the changes and didn't recognise them as moves/renames.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref buffer-disjunction :lexical t
  (require 'quiescent/buffer-disjunction)
#+END_SRC

Shortly after writing this I realised that I actually needed an
operation which is "all the lines which are in this buffer and not
that buffer."

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref this-but-not-that :lexical t
  (require 'quiescent/buffer-set-difference)
#+END_SRC

** Tiny Mode
Ever been coding and just wished that you could type a formatted
sequence of symbols quickly?  Tiny does this in a minimal amount of
keystrokes by expanding a super brief syntax for formatted sequences.

Tiny is a package by the excellent eLisp hacker abo-abo.  It allows one
to create formatted sequences with a very concise syntax.  See [[https://github.com/abo-abo/tiny][this
documentation]] for more.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref tiny-mode :lexical t
  (use-package tiny
      :ensure t
      :config (tiny-setup-default))
#+END_SRC

** Hippie Expand
Emacs comes with a fast auto-guess-expansion system which expands the
word prior to point.  Hippie expand is an extension of this mode which
provides a more sophisticated interface and can complete entire code
blocks.  I just replace the default package (dabbrev) with Hippie
Expand to use this feature.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref hippie-expand :lexical t
  (global-set-key [remap dabbrev-expand] 'hippie-expand)
#+END_SRC

** Avy
Avy is a system designed to make it fast and easy to jump to any point
you can see in Emacs.  It does so by prompting for a character and then
highlighting each visible occurrence with a letter or a sequence of
letters by completing the sequence of letters for the point you want
to jump to your point will move there.  I've bound the avy command I
use all the time to =s-.=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref avy :lexical t
  (require 'quiescent/avy)
#+END_SRC

** Marking and Popping
Marking and popping is the built in mechanism for moving about buffers
to places that you've been and did some kind of move from.  I don't
think that enough of the large movement commands set the mark so to
begin with these settings will make that different.

The first thing that I'm changing here is up-list.  When operating on
a large list or an XML document moves the point a huge distance.  So
the idea is to just make sure that the mark is set when doing going up
list so that I can get back to where I was.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref mark-and-pop :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-push-mark-to-ring (&optional arg escape-string no-syntax-crossing)
    "Double `push-mark' for pushing straight onto the ring.
  Ignore ARG, ESCAPE-STRING and NO-SYNTAX-CROSSING, they're there
  to make the advice work."
    (ignore arg)
    (ignore escape-string)
    (ignore no-syntax-crossing)
    (progn
      (push-mark nil t)
      (push-mark nil t)))

  (defun quiescent-backward-up-list ()
    "Go `backward-up-list' leaving behind the marker."
    (interactive)
    (progn
      (quiescent-push-mark-to-ring)
      (call-interactively #'backward-up-list)))

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-u") #'quiescent-backward-up-list)

  (with-eval-after-load "paredit"
    (define-key paredit-mode-map (kbd "C-M-u") #'quiescent-backward-up-list))

  (advice-add #'nxml-backward-up-element :before
              #'quiescent-push-mark-to-ring)
#+END_SRC

I've found that sometimes popping the mark ring can result in the
point staying where it is.  The same can sometimes be true of popping
the xref ring.  I'd like both of those commands to ensure that the
point ends up moving.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref ensure-pop-moves :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-keep-popping-til-moved (pop-function &rest args)
    "Keep popping the mark until either the mark ring is empty or the point moved."
    (interactive)
    (progn
      (while (and mark-ring
                  (= (point) (marker-position (car mark-ring))))
        (pop mark-ring))
      (apply pop-function args)))

  (advice-add #'pop-to-mark-command :around #'quiescent-keep-popping-til-moved)
#+END_SRC

I've recently discovered that transient mark mode wasn't always the
way that the region worked.  In fact there's almost always a region
even if it's not "active."  It's the region between the mark and the
point.  I like thinking this way, but you do need to be able to see
where the last marks were.  I tried it out for a while and I think
that you lose more than you gain so I'm going back to the way it was
before but with the mark made visible, because that's still very
useful.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref visual-marks :lexical t
  (use-package visible-mark
    :ensure t
    :config (progn
              (global-visible-mark-mode 1)
              (setq visible-mark-max 1)
              (setq visible-mark-faces `(visible-mark-face1 visible-mark-face2))))
#+END_SRC

** Auto Highlight Symbol Mode
Sometimes it can be useful to see the other occurrences of a symbol in
the visible buffer.  Auto Highlight Mode does this for you.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref auto-highlight-symbol :lexical t
  (use-package auto-highlight-symbol
      :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** Hydra
Hydra is an incredibly cool package which allows one to ``chop the
head off of large key bindings'' so to speak.  Some packages have long
base key bindings, e.g.  =C-c C-c C-x <x>= where =<x>= is some postfix
key to select the final action in a package whose base key binding is
=C-c C-c C-x=.  It takes ages to always hit the base binding so Hydra
would let one instead enter a Hydra (read state) at =C-c C-c C-x=
where you could hit any <x> and it would be as if you had hit the base
binding too.

Hydras are incredibly powerful and I wouldn't be able to explain all
there is here.  Check out [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra/wiki/Emacs][this documentation for more info]].  I've added
Hydra to [[Emacs Package Management][my package management]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref hydra :lexical t
  (use-package hydra
    :ensure t
    :config
    (progn
      <<hydra-drawing>>
      <<code-explorer>>
      ))
#+END_SRC

*** My Own Hydras
Naturally one uses Hydra to create their own systems of chopping of
heads and heroic work saving lispery.  What follows are the ones I've
made.

**** Drawing
I also used hydra to create a simple psuedo ASCII drawing mode.  It
keeps track of the line you're on and uses the normal moving key binds
without =<Control>= to move maintaining the current column to give the
appearance of moving about on a canvas.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref hydra-drawing :lexical t
  (require 'quiescent/drawing-interface)
#+END_SRC


**** Code Explorer
This is a hydra which I came up with a while ago and now I'm
resurrecting because previously the features which I wanted weren't
well supported by my Emacs at the time.  I now see projects like
Ensime and LSP as being able to support all of it's features going
forward.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref code-explorer :lexical t
  (require 'quiescent/code-explorer)
#+END_SRC

** Window Jump
Sometimes I want to just move to a window nearby, i.e.  not do a long
distance jump.  For that I'm trying out window-jump to move my point
left/right/up/down in my windows.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref window-jump :lexical t
  (use-package window-jump
    :ensure t
    :init (when (and (boundp 'key-chord-mode)
                     (not key-chord-mode))
            (key-chord-mode 1)
            (bind-chord ",u" #'window-jump-up)
            (bind-chord ",d" #'window-jump-down)
            (bind-chord ",l" #'window-jump-left)
            (bind-chord ",r" #'window-jump-right)))
#+END_SRC

** iSearch
iSearch is an incredibly powerful utility which turns searching into a
fast way of moving around a buffer among other things.  I sometimes
want to kill the thing that is currently highlighted by iSearch.  The
following snippet does just that and comes from the Emacs wiki.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref isearch-kill :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-kill-isearch-match ()
    "Kill the current isearch match string and continue searching."
    (interactive)
    (kill-region isearch-other-end (point))
    (isearch-repeat-forward))

  (define-key isearch-mode-map [(control k)] 'quiescent-kill-isearch-match)
#+END_SRC

Something which I needed this morning was to move to the first hit in
the buffer.  I decided to make it general :)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref isearch-first-last-hit :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-first-search-hit ()
    "Activate isearch from the start of the buffer using the existing string if it's present."
    (interactive)
    (progn
      (let ((original-isearch-string (when isearch-mode isearch-string)))
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (isearch-forward nil t)
        (when original-isearch-string (isearch-yank-string original-isearch-string)))))

  (defun quiescent-last-search-hit ()
    "Activate isearch from the end of the buffer using the existing string if it's present."
    (interactive)
    (progn
      (let ((original-isearch-string (when isearch-mode isearch-string)))
        (goto-char (point-max))
        (isearch-backward nil t)
        (when original-isearch-string (isearch-yank-string original-isearch-string)))))

  (defun quiescent-turn-off-key-chord-mode (&rest _)
    "Turn off `key-chord-mode'."
    (key-chord-mode -1))

  (defun quiescent-turn-on-key-chord-mode (&rest _)
    "Turn on `key-chord-mode'."
    (key-chord-mode 1))

  (advice-add #'isearch-mode :before #'quiescent-turn-off-key-chord-mode)
  (advice-add #'isearch-done :after #'quiescent-turn-on-key-chord-mode)

  (define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "M-<") #'quiescent-first-search-hit)
  (define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "M->") #'quiescent-last-search-hit)

  (global-set-key (kbd "M-s M-<") #'quiescent-first-search-hit)
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-s M->") #'quiescent-last-search-hit)
#+END_SRC

** Iy
In multiple cursors mode I miss the ability to invoke iSearch -- one
of the most important and used packages in my Emacs.  The next best
thing is to either zap to, or move to a particular character.  This is
what Iy mode will give you, and it's not only for multiple cursors
this is just the best case I could think of.

** Cross Link
I've recently come up with the idea of ad hoc cross linking buffers
together based on the symbol at point.  The basic idea is that you
first invoke it in a buffer creating a link to another buffer on the
first invocation.  It will remember the buffer it was first used with
and cross link to that buffer every time it is invoked from the
starting buffer, until a clear command is called.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref quiescent-cross-link :lexical t
  (require 'quiescent/cross-link-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Multiple Cursors
I've always heard that multiple cursors is a very good mode.  Until
recently I thought that it might just be a clone of modes from
programs like IntelliJ and Sublime.  What made me decide to try it out
in the end was a package I came across called Mark multiple.  The idea
with this package is that you can mark multiple regions and mark further
regions based on what really marked and then apply edits to all the
marked regions.

It turns out that this functionality is built into multiple cursors.  I
generally do the kind of editing that people advertise from multiple
cursors using macros, but the ability to select further subregions
based on what's already selected is really something that goes beyond
macros.  This is what made me decide to try it out.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref multiple-cursors :lexical t
  (use-package multiple-cursors
    :ensure t
    :config
    (progn
      (global-set-key (kbd "s-SPC")   #'mc/edit-lines)
      (global-set-key (kbd "C->")     #'mc/mark-next-like-this)
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-<")     #'mc/mark-previous-like-this)
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-<") #'mc/mark-all-like-this)
      (global-set-key (kbd "s->")     #'mc/skip-to-next-like-this)
      (global-set-key (kbd "s-<")     #'mc/skip-to-previous-like-this)))
#+END_SRC

** IEdit Mode
There is also a widely used package which allows one to edit multiple
occurrences of a symbol in the current buffer.  It's called IEdit mode
and it's available via ELPA.  The difference between it and mc is that
it serves a narrower purpose and so can be lighter weight.  i.e.  if all
you want to do is edit and not run the same generic commands
everywhere that a symbol occurs then IEdit does that a bit more neatly
than mc.  However IEdit isn't as generic as mc.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref iedit :lexical t
  (use-package iedit
      :ensure t
      :config (global-set-key (kbd "M-s ,") #'iedit-mode))
#+END_SRC

** "Scroll" Through History
I just read XKCD #1806 and the tool tip says that it would be cool to
bind the scroll wheel to undo and redo /if a program could keep up
with it/.  Well let's see if Emacs can!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref hiscroll :lexical t
  (define-minor-mode hiscroll-mode
    "Toggle hiscroll-mode.
  Interactively with no argument, this command toggles the mode.
  A positive prefix argument enables the mode, any other prefix
  argument disables it.  From Lisp, argument omitted or nil enables
  the mode, `toggle' toggles the state.

  When hiscroll-mode is enabled the mouse wheel will move the
  current buffer through time (i.e. undo/redo while you scroll.)"
    :init-value nil
    :lighter " HiS"
    :keymap
    '(([mouse-5] . hiscroll-undo)
      ([mouse-4] . hiscroll-redo))
    :group 'hiscroll)

  (defvar hiscroll-undo-direction 'UNDO
    "The direction to go in history of changes for this buffer.")

  (defun hiscroll--correct-direction-and-go (desired-direction)
    "Correct the direction of undoing to DESIRED-DIRECTION and then undo."

    "Reverse the direction of history if necessary and then continue redoing."
    (interactive)

** Recursive Editing
I really like the idea of recursive editing sessions.  I want to be
doing something look somewhere else and come back to where I was by
quitting that short session.  I'm going to bind it to =s-R=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref general-recursive-session :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-general-recursive-edit ()
    "Enter a recursive editing session remembering the window config etc."
    (interactive)
    (save-excursion
      (save-window-excursion
        (recursive-edit))))

  (global-set-key (kbd "s-R") #'quiescent-general-recursive-edit)
#+END_SRC

** Composable
There is a concept in VIM that objects and actions are orthogonal.
i.e.  what you can do can be done to all things.  This is a powerful
idea because it means that you don't have to remember as many bindings
and if any new actions or objects are added they are automatically
actionable by any the other kind.  A realisation that an Emacsen had
was that Emacs could easily support this idea because it already has
actions and objects built in and various commands for using them (just
not by the same name.)  Importantly one can continue using Emacs the
same way even with composable turned on!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref composable :lexical t
  (eval-and-compile
      (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/composable.el/")

I've long since abandoned this completion file and instead I'm going

supported completion framework.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref company-mode :lexical t

In text mode I only want company to work from my flyspell dictionary
and then from dabbrev.  I think that the other back ends are slowing
it down quite a bit.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref company-text-mode-backends :lexical t

It's useful to keep track of the most used completions per context
because in practice placing these at the top of the list tends to be a
good expericence.  Company has a mode for that called
`company-statistics'.

** Emacs Complete Lines
Redguardtoo has released a package which attempts to complete the
lines following point based on grep hits in the project.  It looks
amazing for web dev so I'm going to give it a bash.

It turns out though that it's not a package so I'm going to have to do
a manual install of it.  I'll take a look a bit later.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref eacl :lexical t

** Pair Programming
I'm starting to do more and more pair programming and one of the
stumbling blocks which I have is that the person reading my code is
accustomed to a number of things.  The first of which is that their
editor/IDE always has line numbers showing.  The second is that
they'll almost certainly have the current line highlighted and
sometimes outlined.  I've decided to create a mode based on the pair
programming which I'm doing write now and call it "Matt is Watching
Mode".

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref matt-is-watching :lexical t
  (define-minor-mode global-matt-is-watching-mode
    "Toggle global-matt-is-watching-mode.

** RealGUD
RealGUD is a package which aims to provide more debugging support to
Emacs than comes standard.  I'm going to start using it for debugging
from within Emacs where GUD doesn't yet have support for a debugger.
What prompted me to use it was the apparent lack of support for pdb on
Windows.

In order to start using it you must run the following command:
=M-x load-library RET realgud RET=

** Cleaning up Files
A lot of the code which I work on is poorly formatted and has tabs in
it -_- To rectify this I've written a function which cleans up a file
in one fell swoop.

  (defun quiescent-clean-file ()

** Flycheck Mode
Flycheck mode provides interactive syntax checking through integration
with compilers and regular expression based syntax checkers (which it
has built in.) It checks files while your editing and, like Flyspell,
underlines mistakes.  At the moment I use it everywhere, because I'm
yet to decide where I want it to be enabled and it seems pretty useful
so far.

** Flymake Mode
Flymake is a competitor to Flycheck which is:
 - in core Emacs;
 - was recently remade and vastly improved;

I'd like to try using it over Flycheck because I have a feeling that
(especially considering the man who wrote it) it'll do a better job of
being fast, streamlined and that it'll make better use of current
Emacs features.

** Hide Show Mode
Emacs has a built in mode for hiding and showing source code blocks in
various languages.  I find it useful in java when classes get very big
and you want to see a summary of the methods without the noise, or in
XML where you're interested in the elements at a particular depth.

I toggle between show and hide using a custom snippet I got from the
emacs wiki.

By default show-hide doesn't support folding in HTML and XML very
well.  I use a snippet from the Emacs wiki to solve that.

I've chosen a few language modes to load show hide in.

** Yasnippet
Yasnippet is a powerful snippet editing and insertion engine with
support for transforms in elisp and a lot of available snippets for
various languages.  I have it load snippets from my snippets
directory.  This isn't separate because of OS concerns.  It's separate
because I have to point Yasnippet at it to load it and if were in the

There's a strange interaction between company mode and yasnippet.  If
you're using yasnippet and company together then sometimes you can be
busy completing something and not be able to call the yas completion
of the thing at point.  I found an SO post addressing this issue but
it has a lot more than I need because it tries to make tab super
powerful.  I don't want to change Tab because I have auto completion
with company.  Instead I'm going to just bind tab in company mode to
complete with company or yasnippet from their post.  For reference:
[[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/7908/how-to-make-yasnippet-and-company-work-nicer#7925]].

** Skeletons

Skeletons is another templating system which provides features similar
to Yasnippet.  Skeletons defined snippets using an Emacs Lisp
macro.  First line of the macro is a doc string and subsequent lines
are the lines to generate.  You can generate skeletons which accept
arbitrarily many inputs by creating a skeleton which accept a skeleton
as input.  In doing so the skeleton is not completed until its sub-
skeletons have completed.

I've also decided to use skeletons to make general SQL statements.

** Paredit
Paredit is a package which only allows edits to the abstract syntax
tree in lisp modes.  This enforces the structure of code to always be
correct and allows for fast robust manipulation of the way code is
interpreted and executed.

I've enabled paredit in various lisp modes as suggested by [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit][it's
documentation on the Emacs wiki]].  I've also included a patch from the
Emacs wiki which prevents hippi-expand from inserting an extra
parenthesis in paredit mode.

** Electric Pair Mode
So Emacs has a built in mode for pairing brackets.  It looks a lot
simpler than smart parens and I think that because of the nature of it
being integrated with Emacs proper it'll "just work" with everything

*** Notes about ~elec-pair~
**** Not a Bug: Comments with lists across lines
When there's a comment with a list across lines then it finds that
things are unbalanced.  This can be tested by moving forward list in
the current buffer until Emacs errors out.  I wonder whether there's a
way of fixing this problem.

ADDENDUM: It looks like the problem is actually that it finds
unbalanced pairs in comments and thinks that the current pair is
unbalanced.

I've since discovered that this is behaving as it was
designed. There's something which you have to set (not sure where it
was always this way) which ignores the balanced parentheses in
comments when scanning.  Scanning is used by ~electric-pair~ to help
you keep brackets balanced.

** Save Place
This is a cool mode which I discovered in the Emacs 25 NEWS over on
Mickey's website.  You can tell Emacs to remember where you were in
every file you open *mind blown*.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref save-place :lexical t

#+END_SRC

** Narrowing
Emacs has a system where you can narrow the scope of what you can
edit.  The package usually hides everything else while you're narrowed
which is slightly irritating because you might want to have some
context to what you're busy editing.  Thankfully abo-abo has an answer
to that: fancy-narrow.

** Emacs Refactor
I recently had the need to grab code of a buffer and put it into
functions just to organise it.  It turns out that there's a
refactoring package for that.  The suggestion is to bind it to
=M-<ENTER>= ... I wonder why ;) The more I do this, the more my Emacs
becomes closer to an IDE.  I suppose that the needs direct where I end
up with this.

** Temp Buffers
Sometimes I want to see what a piece of code would look like in a temp
buffer in the correct mode.  For example, if I've been given some JSON
but it's all flat then I'd want to see what the structure looks like
rather than seeing the flat string.

In this section I hope to create a utility function which will detect
the kind of content in the current region and put that into an
appropirate buffer with the correct mode and preprocessing already
done.

I've come to realise that I can also automatically detect this kind of
content in the output of eshell.  I think that the heuristic has to
have a cut off so that I don't try to do it to extremely long lines,
but the idea is that I just iterate over lines detecting content to
format and format it!

** Random Test Data
I need to generate test data quite a bit when I'm writing unit tests.
This can be time consuming.  It's also difficult to macro it; so
instead I'm going to provide a couple of functions to generate useful
random data here and then use them in macros.

** Editor Config
There is a project out there which is intended to help people write
code which conforms with how everyone on the project is writing code.
It's called editor config and there is, of course, an integration for

ahead and installed that too.

** Eval on Save
My experiment with =live-eval= was partly a success but had some faults:
 1. If you were busy naming a =defun= then you would have tonnes of
    spurious =defuns= added to the environment.
 2. It would hang Emacs.
 3. It would move the point around.
 4. It was hard to control when it should be doing it's work.

A second attempt at a similar thing would be to simply =eval= the
whole buffer, form by form, whenever I save the buffer to file.  That
way I can get completion on functions which I've just run, have forms
which do smaller tests, run the whole time and not have to deal with
the above problems.

** Too Long Lines
Emacs has a problem...  It can't edit lines which are too long.  This
is caused by it's implementation of fontification and other line
sensitive features on it's representation of text -- a gap buffer.
See [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/09/07/][this article]] for an explanation of gap buffers.

** Ediff Hacks
Emacs has a bunch of tools for diffing and conflict resolution built
in.  e.g. if you want something which can be used to choose between
options at point and move between conflicts in one buffer then
=smerge= will do everything you need.

There's also a much more comprehensive diffing package which has
integrations with the built in VC package.  It's called =ediff=.  With
it you can diff directories and files and you can resolve conflicts.

Something which I've always wished a diffing tool would have is the
choice of putting both options into the result buffer.  Thankfully
killdash9 on SO has the answer [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9656311/conflict-resolution-with-emacs-ediff-how-can-i-take-the-changes-of-both-version][here]]!

** Helm Mode
Helm mode used to be called Anything.el because it allowed one to
perform actions of any kind on any thing.  I imagine that it's name
changed because it's also a bit like being at the helm of a
complicated and powerful ship.

The basic idea of helm is that you are presented with a list of things
which have originated from some context.  e.g. a list of files in the
current directory.  Given that list, you may narrow it using multiple
out of order regular expressions.  Each regular expression reduces the
number of matches from the previous set.

You can search through the content of the items in the list (for
example if the items were files then grep the files) as well to
perform further narrowing.  Once you're happy with your list you can
select an item or mark multiple items and select an action to act on
your selection.

I want my helm to load in the current buffer instead of in the other
buffer (which is the default.) I also want helm to keep track of
recent files in helm minibuffer.  I found the other options I've
configured for helm in an [[https://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html][introduction to helm]].

Before we can configure helm we need to load the package.

** Shell
Sneakypeet is a developer who I met while working at Entelect.  I
convinced him to start using Emacs by using it to do a presentation at
the Clojure meetup.  He wanted to create a collection of shells for a
project using directories for those shells and by running some basic
command when you get there.  He sent me some Emacs Lisp to look at.
I've ammended it and included it below.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref sneaky-shells :lexical t
  (defun sneaky-execute-in-current-shell (cmd)
    "Execute CMD in the current shell."
    (progn
      (insert cmd)
      (comint-send-input)))

  (defun sneaky-prep-shell-for-command (shell-name &optional dir)
    "Create a shell buffer with the name SHELL-NAME or switch to it and interrupt jobs.

  Ensure that the shell is running in DIR, if supplied."
    (progn
      (when (null (get-buffer shell-name))
        (let ((default-directory (or dir default-directory)))
          (shell shell-name)))
      (switch-to-buffer-other-window shell-name)
      (comint-interrupt-subjob)))

  (defun sneaky-run-shells (&rest shells)
    "Run each shell description in SHELLS.

  A shell should be a list of the form (SHELL-NAME DIR CMD)."
    (mapc (pcase-lambda (`(,shell-name ,dir ,cmd))
            (progn
              (sneaky-prep-shell-for-command shell-name dir)
              (sneaky-execute-in-current-shell cmd)))
          shells))
#+END_SRC

Here's an example usage which I'm using to test how well this works.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :lexical t

I want my shells to have very small mode lines and fringes so that I

It's a good idea to run a continuous compilation buffer while
developing.  Sometimes there's not really a good way to get to the
compilation command or you want to switch in between compilation and a

** eShell
Eshell is an extremely powerful shell which comes standard with
Emacs.  I liked an idea I read in the [[https://www.masteringemacs.org][Mastering Emacs]] book about
keeping the cursor at the start like "plan 9" shell used to do
(apparently) so I've done the same.  Basically the point stays with the
command when you execute it so that you can edit and redo the command
rapidly instead of using a history command or pasting the command
again and again.

The aforementioned optimisation and a host of others are included in
my =eshell.el=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref eshell-setup :lexical t
  (require 'quiescent/eshell)
#+END_SRC

I'd like eshell to be able to interpret errors in output as well.  So
I'm going to add a mode which hooks into redrawing the prompt and
finds errors in the output of the last command.

(This is very much a work in progress.)

*** Company Eshell Auto-Suggest
I recently read a blog post in which someone used the [[Completion Setup][sort of
completion I use everywhere]] for your eShell history.  Since the blog
post it's become a package on Melpa(!)

The back end in eShell auto suggest doesn't consider all candidates,
which I find very irritating.  It also doesn't do any kind of fuzzy
matching on history elements.  I'm going to solve the first problem
now and the second problem at a later point in time.

(I think that merging history candidates with the CAPF for shells
would do the trick because of the new ='flex= method for completion.)

** Project
Emacs now has a built in project convenience library/package/thing
(honestly I'm not sure what the best name is for sources which appear
in the Emacs project, but which aren't packages or modules.)  I'm
going to port the work I did for projectile two step search to project
find file.  I think that it'll be useful and I'd like to give it to a
colleague to help him improve his work flow.

*** Bindings for Project
In the interim it would seem that projectile is broken with the latest
Emacs (26) so I'm going to go ahead and bind project find file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref project-find-file :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-find-file-in-project ()
    "Find file in the current project using helm."
    (interactive)
    (let ((completing-read-function #'helm--completing-read-default))
      (project-find-file)))

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-P") #'quiescent-find-file-in-project)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c p f") #'quiescent-find-file-in-project)
#+END_SRC

I'd like to find a project file in a split window.  I need both a
function and a binding for this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref project-find-file-other-window :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-project-find-file-other-window ()
    "Find a project file in another window."
    (interactive)
    (let* ((project (project-current t))
           (dirs (project-roots project))
           (table (project-file-completion-table project dirs))
           (file (project--completing-read-strict
                  "Find file" table nil nil
                  (thing-at-point 'filename)))
           (buffer (find-file-noselect file)))
      (pop-to-buffer buffer)))

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 4 C-S-P") #'quiescent-project-find-file-other-window)
#+END_SRC

It's also a necessity that it uses VC rather than trying to use EDE;
because I hardly use EDE anywhere when I'm doing my development.  I'm
going to put this setting and other general settings here.

** Etags
Emacs has good support for using tags files to find stuff.  I've been
using it more and more.  It is approximate, but with some diligence it
can be incredibly powerful as a means of accelerating searching etc.

*** Searching for a Tag
Etags includes the means to do an interactive search for a tag.  I
want to be able to use this more conveniently, so I'm going to bind it
to =s-s=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref etags-tag-search :lexical t
  (require 'thingatpt)

  (defun quiescent-etag-isearch (point)
    "Search for a tag in the current project.

  Default the search to the symbol at POINT."

    (let* ((default-symbol (thing-at-point 'symbol t))
           (search-term    (completing-read "Search term: "
                                            (list default-symbol)
                                            nil
                                            nil
                                            default-symbol)))

#+END_SRC

*** Generating Tags for a Project
It's convenient to generate tags for the project which you're in on
either a timer or when a file changes.  The timer approach is the
simplest and I'm going to start there.  Later I'll make other
improvements to the idea.

(I think that project scoped variables were added to project recently.
I should take a look at using that feature in the
`project-command-at-interval' library.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref project-command-at-interval :lexical t

  (require 'project-command-at-interval)
#+END_SRC

** Goto Chg
EMACS provides a feature known as the mark ring (there are many other
rings as well) which allows one to jump between the points which were
marked in the local buffer and across buffer boundaries.  What this
doesn't necessarily track is the last place where an edit was
made.

What I used to do to get to the last place that I edited would be to
undo a change and have the buffer jump to that point.  This sucks,
because I need to make an edit and then undo twice to jump back to the
correct point on the edit ring.  Instead of doing that I've installed a
package called goto-chg, which provides a change history.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref goto-chg :lexical t
  (use-package goto-chg
    :ensure t
    :config (progn

#+END_SRC

** GREP
Grep is possibly the most ubiquitous search tool available in any Unix
like environment.  It's flexibility and power make it a favourite of
many programmers.

*** VC Git Grep
It turns out that I can call grep via git and that emacs has a
interface to it.  The advantage of this is that I can grep and get
results which ignore non-version controlled files.  This will greatly
speed up grep and also give me more relevant hits.

I'm replacing the old binding I had for =rgrep= in place for this
purpose and I'm going to make a modification to it that it doesn't ask
for the directory and just uses `vc-dir'.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref vc-git-grep :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-vc-git-grep (regexp &optional files)
    "Search for REGEXP in the current project using grep.

    ;; This comes from the definition of `vc-git-grep'
    (interactive
     (progn
       (grep-compute-defaults)
       (cond
        ((equal current-prefix-arg '(16))

                                     nil nil 'grep-history)
               nil))
        (t (let* ((regexp (grep-read-regexp))
                  (files (grep-read-files regexp)))

** IDUTILS
I've been wanting a way to search through large bases of text very
quickly since I started working on gigantic projects (~10K+ files).
Searching that many files takes tools like grep far too long and the
solution has to be that the files must instead be indexed.  IDUTILS
provides indexing and searching of that index.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref idutils :lexical t

** Backup File
Emacs has a great feature for recovering work when it could be lost.
It backs up files which you edit.  By default it'll backup a file,
with a copy of that file in the same directory, when you open it for
the first time.  This isn't nearly as aggressive as I'd like it to be.
It turns out that you can get Emacs to make multiple backups and also
to put them into a different directory where all of your work is safe
and backed up.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref backup-files :lexical t

** GTags
GNU Global is a tagging program which creates a binary database across

** Smartscan Mode
Something I often do is search for the thing at point.  Mickey at
[[https://www.masteringemacs.org][Mastering Emacs]] wrote a package to cycle through occurrences of symbol
at point.  It's so simple and yet insanely useful for jumping between
usages and searching logs among other things.

** Writable Grep
It's possible to edit a Grep buffer and apply those changes to the
lines in the original files.  This is so incredibly cool that I just

** Read Only Regions
Sometimes you can lose control of a region of text which has become
read only.  I've decided to add interactive functions for adding and
removing the read only property on such text so that I can manually
intervene.  Inspired by [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20023363/emacs-remove-region-read-only][this post]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref read-only :lexical t

** Go Up
I recently saw a friend of mine use a keybinding in his terminal:
C-<UP>.  It moved a directory upwards.  I thought to myself.  I need
this in my life.  So here it begins... and if it becomes useful, it
will grow.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref go-up :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-one-directory-above-current ()
    "Produce the directory one above the current one."
    (file-name-directory (substring default-directory
                                    0
                                    (- (length default-directory)
                                       1))))

  (defun quiescent-go-up ()
    "Do the thing which would most logically be considered going up in the current mode."
    (interactive)
    (cond
     ((eq major-mode 'eshell-mode)
      (progn
        (setq default-directory
              (quiescent-one-directory-above-current))
        (eshell-send-input)))
     ((eq major-mode 'dired-mode)
      (dired-up-directory))
     ((eq major-mode 'shell-mode)
      (progn
        (insert "cd ..")
        (comint-send-input)))
     ((eq major-mode 'minibuffer-inactive-mode)
      ;; TODO: Handle home dir
      (progn
        (end-of-line)
        (backward-char)
        (when (looking-at "/")
          (delete-char 1))
        (ignore-errors (forward-char))
        (zap-to-char -1 ?/)
        (insert "/")))
     (t
      (find-file default-directory))))

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-^") #'quiescent-go-up)
#+END_SRC

Update: it grew beyond shells.  I can now hit =C-^= from just about
anywhere and it does a context sensitive "up" command.

** Numbering Adjustment
I often find myself performing edits which are really just adjusting
numbering on a list.  For instance I could find myself needing to add
an element to the middle of a numbered list and need to increment all
subsequent elements.  The most common operation is to increment (or
decrement) the number at point -- as below:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref increment-number-at-point :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-increment-number-at-point ()
    "Increment the number at point.

  Assume that we're in a number.  Behaviour is undefined when we're
  outside of one."
    (interactive)
    (save-excursion
      (progn
        (skip-chars-backward "0123456789")
        (let ((start-of-number (point))
              end-of-number
              number)
          (when (not (looking-at "[0-9]+"))
            (error "No number to increment"))
          (replace-match (format "%s" (1+ (string-to-number (match-string 0)))))))))

  (defun quiescent-decrement-number-at-point ()
    "Increment the number at point.

  Assume that we're in a number.  Behaviour is undefined when we're
  outside of one."
    (interactive)
    (save-excursion
      (progn
        (skip-chars-backward "0123456789")
        (let ((start-of-number (point))
              end-of-number
              number)
          (when (not (looking-at "[0-9]+"))
            (error "No number to increment"))
          (replace-match (format "%s" (1- (string-to-number (match-string 0)))))))))
#+END_SRC

** Recent Files
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref recentf :exports none :lexical t
  <<recentf-mode>>
  <<recentf-ext>>
#+END_SRC
There is a facility in Emacs to keep a list of the files which have
been recently visited (in the order of how recently they were
visited).  IDO has a mode where these files are listed along side the
buffers you could switch to.  I want this! :P The following sets up
recentf mode, next I'll need to add them to the list of buffers to
switch to when doing switch buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref recentf-mode :lexical t
  (require 'recentf)

  (defun quiescent-open-recent-file ()
    "Open a recent file use recentf for completion."
    (interactive)
    (find-file (completing-read "Recent file: " recentf-list)))

  (use-package recentf
    :init (recentf-mode t)
    :defer 10
    :config (progn
              (setq recentf-max-saved-items 50)
              (run-at-time nil (* 5 60) 'recentf-save-list)))
#+END_SRC

The following library adds support for dired and also makes it so that
when you switch buffer it becomes the most recent file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref recentf-ext :lexical t
  (use-package recentf-ext
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

Now for the magical part.  I'm going to combine buffer switch with
recentf so that I can switch to any buffer including recently open
ones with switch buffer... Here goes.  On second thought I shouldn't
need this because I switch to active buffers with =C-z= so I can use a
different binding for recent files/buffers.

** Ignore That Case
I often want a Regex to work while ignoring the case of the phrases
which it matches.  This code will replace the alpha-only word at point
with a case insensitive version of it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref ignore-regex-case :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-ignore-regex-case ()
    "Replace the alpha-only word at point with a case insensitive version."
    (interactive)
    (progn
      (search-backward-regexp "[a-zA-Z]*[^a-zA-Z]")
      (forward-char)
      (save-match-data
        (save-excursion
          (search-forward-regexp "\\([a-zA-Z]*\\)[^a-zA-Z]?"))
        (replace-match (mapconcat (lambda (char) (list ?\[ char (upcase char) ?\]))
                                  (downcase (match-string 0)) "")))))
#+END_SRC

** Keyboard Macros
So the default binding either involves <F3>, which is a bit out of the
way, or =C-x (= which is a bit too much for something that you'd want
to do quickly.  I'm going for =S-(= now instead.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref keyboard-macros :lexical t
  (global-set-key (kbd "s-(") #'kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter)
  (global-set-key (kbd "s-)") #'kmacro-end-or-call-macro)
#+END_SRC

** String Replacement
There are some common editing tasks which have no keybinding.
Replacing a string is one of those.  I've put that somewhere
convenient, but I'm not sure that it's actually the best way of doing
the task anymore.

When I wrote this keybinding I was unaware of the features in
=isearch= which allow one to perform similar actions in a more
interactive mode.  You can now =C-s <m a t c h i n g l e t t e r s>
M-% <r e p l a c e m e n t>= and get an interactive replacement.  If
you're satisfied with the replacement you can hit bang to make it so
across the board.

(global-set-key (kbd "C-c r") 'replace-string)
#+END_SRC

** Moving In Aligned Text
I often find myself in a large buffer with an data laid out with one
entry per line.  If I'm in a profile report (which I'm in a lot
recently) then this data is usually a call graph and it's organised
one entry per line and indented to indicate the level of the call
graph.

Navigating this data can be frustrating, because you might want to see
the other entries at the same level as the one which you're on at the
moment.  What fallows is an implementation of a simple next/previous
entry at same level command so that it's easier to work with this
data.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref aligned-navigation :lexical t

** Semantic
Semantic is a parser generator and set of tools for use with Emacs
which enables Emacs to understand more about the programming language
which the code represents.  This information is used to improve how
buffers are navigated, completions made etc.  There's been some recent
discussion on the mailing list about making parsing a first class
feature.  I'm interested in whether this can be achieved with
semantic.

This will be the latest in a long list of attempts to use semantic as
part of my Emacs.  This time though, I have a much better
understanding of everything that it uses and how it comes together,
and I have a plan to make it work for large projects.

I discovered a mode which enables one to edit commends and strings in

that you can benefit from all of the facilities of editing text while

It's been said that a programming language can't call itself a
"programming language" until it has a major mode in EMACS.  What
follows is the way that I've customised the major modes for the
languages which I use.

** Julia
I need a mode to write Julia because I had a pair programming session
with a friend from a Clojure meetup.  We ended up spending a lot of
time looking at our editors instead of solving the problem which was a
lot of fun and very informative.  One of the core ideas which Josh
expressed is that the Vim philosophy of orthogonal text objects and
the things you can do with them should be formally specified so that
it can be implemented in different editors.  I really liked some of
the ideas I saw, for instance:
 - Repeat command: a sort of auto macro-ing mode which records what
   you did when you were in edit mode and then lets you repeat it.  I
   could have a similar thing in Emacs by just remembering the last
   commands and then repeating them with a key-binding.  To make this
   really useful I would have to consider how to start and stop
   recording in a natural way so that you don't have insane stretches
   being recorded.
 - The other idea which I'd like to steal is frecency, something
   supported very well by FASD which is a command line tool for
   jumping about.  The idea in Emacs would be to super charge =M-x=
   and =C-x C-f= so that they presented more likely options first.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref julia :lexical t

We ended up implemented the sieve of Eratosthenes and it was
surprisingly compact and fast.  Here it is:

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :lexical t :tangle no
  function seive(max)
      i = 2
      xs = [1:max;]
      while (i < sqrt(max))
          if (xs[i] != 0)
              for j in [i+i:i:max;]
                  xs[j] = false
              end
          end
          i += 1
      end
      return filter(x -> x != 0, xs)
  end

  print(seive(100))
#+END_SRC

** YAML
Yet Another Markdown Language is a highly structured, and human
readable, format for serialising data to.  It's less of a markdown
format and more of a rigid file specification usually used for
configuration and settings.  I've gotten a mode for editing it
predominantly for font lock features so that it's easier to see
mistakes.  It tends to do a better job of indenting text as well
though because you can cycle through the indentation options rather
than having your editor dumbly continue to tab the text further and
further from it's correct position.

** Groovy
Groovy is a dynamically typed language based on Java.  It's pretty
cool, and it can be used to specify pipelines for Jenkins.  I'm adding
it mainly for the highlighting, but it says that it's based on CC mode
so it should have a bunch of features which I'm as of yet unaware of.

** C Mode
Emacs comes with a c mode which provides basic editing support for
several c style languages including integration with the debugger and
syntax highlighting.  I have configured mine to use the Linux style of
code indentation.

NOTE: I've included pre-save hooks in here which I should consider
extending to support more languages.

** Plant UML
I use plant UML to draw diagrams for documentation among other things.
I've decided to add this mode for it's ability to syntax highlight,
but I might find other features as I use it more.

** RJSX Mode
A colleague of mine recently showed me a mode which extends js2-mode
for JSX files.  I'm going to make it the official mode for editing JSX
because my weird combination of web, built in and other modes for
editing them isn't all that graceful.

NOTE: I need to checkout the new stuff in Emacs27 for highlighting and
correctly indenting JSX.  It sounds pretty awesome from what I've read
on the mailing list.

** nXML
nXML mode is used to edit XML.  It's a pretty solid mode, but even so
I've built up a few modifications to it to improve the experience.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref nxml-mode :lexical t
  (require 'nxml-mode)

  (defun pretty-print-xml (begin end)

** SQL Mode
Emacs doesn't come with a built in means of formatting SQL so I looked
around and found SQL indent.  Going to see if it fits the bill.

Update: it turns out that this package isn't all that great at
indenting sql code.  I've left it's ref out of the section tangle and
kept the definition here for reference.

Deprecated because it doesn't actually work all that well...
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref sql-indent :lexical t
  (use-package sql-indent
    :ensure t
    :config (eval-after-load "sql"
              '(load-library "sql-indent")))
#+END_SRC

I have an idea for completion in SQL buffers:
 - Define a fixed list of completion options
 - Use thing at point to do a fuzzy search through the list of items
 - Present those as candidates to completion-ui

In my system specific tasks file I can define lists of symbols
relevant for completion in each DB I connect to, as a buffer local
variable, to override the definition of the list here.

NOTE: This worked quite well in a job where I edited a lot of SQL.
These days I don't.  I've since learned that `pcomplete', a built in
package, was designed for this exact task.  I should try using it next
time that I need something like this.

I've recently been writing some Javascript in order to prepare for a

**** Eslint
I've found that it's useful to be able to include hooks to modes for
things like fixing linting and then remove them later.  This section
is dedicated to doing that sort of thing for Javascript.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref eslint-fix-mode :lexical t

this work:

 - eslint-plugin-react
 - eslint-plugin-prettier
 - eslint-config-react
 - eslint-config-prettier
 - babel-eslint
 - eslint-config-google
 - prettier

Here's an alternative idea to fixing linting errors.  Provide
something which parses the output of a Linter via Flycheck and applies
the recommendation to the code at point.

I've recently discovered Nicolas Peton's blog: [[https://emacs.cafe/][Emacs Cafe]].  It has a
nice series on setting up Emacs for Javascript editing.  I'm going to
incorporate some of the stuff which he talks about.

**** JS2 Imenu
The first feature which I'm kicking myself for not seeing at first is
Imenu support for js2-mode symbols!  This doesn't really need any
further introduction and it's easy to configure.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref js2-mode-extras :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-activate-js2-imenu-extras ()
    "Activate `js2-imenu-extras-mode'."

      (js2-imenu-extras-mode 1)))

  (add-hook 'js2-mode-hook #'quiescent-activate-js2-imenu-extras)
#+END_SRC

Out of the box JS2 imenu support doesn't add constants to the menu.
This sucks if you declare a lot of your functions as constants --
which I do when I'm using Ramda.  The key to solving this is to add a
case for handling =var= declarations (and maybe =let= and =const= too)
e.g. =js2-var-decl-node-p= to =js2-imene-walk-ast=.  I don't have the
time right now but I'm pretty sure that I'll be taking a look soon.

**** NodeJS Repl
Sometimes you want to just work with a REPL for some Node code that
you're hacking away it.  In those instances full-blown installations
like Indium provide too much functionality and require that you setup
a whole project.  In those instances I prefer to just connect to a
REPL and run some commands.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref nodejs-repl :lexical t

** Rust
I went to a meet up on 12/04/2016 for functional programming -- it was

** Clojure
Yet another server-based program for editing code in Emacs is CIDER.
It's inspired by SLIME but indented for use with Closure.  I've
installed it because I'm going to a Clojure meet up tomorrow with the
intention of learning the language.  It's really a full day workshop.
Perhaps I'll add to this file as I start customising my Emacs to work
well during the workshop.

** Emacs Lisp
I write a lot of Emacs lisp these days.  I've started finding it more
convenient to write complex scripts for my operating system using
Emacs lisp rather than anything else.  With that in mind I've started
to aggregate some cool features which I'll use while editing Emacs
Lisp code.

One of the first things that I want to do is port over the live
editing hook I wrote for CIDER into Emacs Lisp so that evaluation
overlays are displayed as I edit the code.  It will also mean that any
Ielm instance I have running will be updated automatically.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref emacs-lisp :lexical t

While writing Emacs Lisp, I've started to learn edebug and in this
instance I'm using it as a tool for understanding how the semantic db
is being used to do smart completions etc. -- because right now it's a
little bit too slow and it's starting to get in the way of efficiency.

I watched an intro to edebug and here are some of the headlines:

 - Instrument with C-u C-M-x
 - Start debugging by evaluating something which uses it
 - Goto here with 'h'
 - Set a breakpoint with 'b'
 - Continue with 'g'
 - Continue over breakpoints with 'G'
 - Go into a function definition (has to be instrumented) with 'i'
 - Use macro step to exand macros by first calling 'macro-step' and
   then 'e' to expand and 'c' to contract
 - Once expanded, macros can also be debugged.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref macrostep :lexical t
  (use-package macrostep
      :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

I recently studied the special form `condition-case'.  This is the
construction in EMACS Lisp which allows the user to handle errors.  It
turns out that debug on error is ignored by condition-case and the
other error handling constructs.  So if I need to debug errors which
are already handled by these constructs then I need another way to
trigger the debugger.

That's where debug on signal comes in.  This is a flag which allows for
the debugging of all signals whether or not they are covered by a
condition-case.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref debug-signals :lexical t

** Scala
I recently started using Ensime.  A mode which is intended to connect
to a server to provide asynchronous parsing of Java and Scala files to
statically analyse the code and improve the editing experience.

It also has some more advanced features such as debugging and running
of the application.  I'm planning on learning as I go.

I recently learned that the development of Ensime has all but halted.
During the time that I used Ensime I found that it would sometimes
struggle with larger projects (like the one which I worked on at work
at the time).  With development coming to a stand still I have very
little hope that these sorts of problems will be rectified.  I've
decided to use the Metals language server instead and so far it's
working just fine.  It lacks some of the auxiliary features of Ensime
(such as interactive development with a REPL and implicit type
conversion hints) but it does the most important stuff (navigation,
completion and error hints) well.

Ensime has a strange interaction with yasnippet.  This needs to be
corrected much like the code I have for making indentation, completion
etc. work in other modes.  This is done by simply deferring the TAB
binding to another mode (i.e. not overwriting it for scala-mode
alone.)

UPDATE: I'm not sure whether this is necessary since I switched to LSP
for Scala.

*** Scala Edit String
Two colleagues of mine were recently working on a code generator for
an API based on YAML description files.  The generator contains large
segments of Scala in strings.  It's difficult to maintain those
strings because you don't have syntax highlighting etc.  I realised
that you could make like markdown/org mode and edit these strings in
their own buffers.  This is what I came up with in about 10 minutes.

** Kotlin
At some point the developers of the best IDE out there (IntelliJ Idea)
figured out that, with the way that Java generally gets written, it's
pretty hard to make a robust application.  The developers embarked on
the task of making a better Java without making it "complicated" like
functional programming.  In my opinion this was a terrible idea
because they've encoded a lot of ideas from functional programming
without leveraging the rigorous methodologies which underpin it.  This
means that their abstractions have flaws: null pointer exceptions are
easy to come by for instance and functions aren't quite first class.
Either way it's still better than Java for the kind of programming
which enterprise Java made popular and I come across it from time to
time so I decided to install it.  I also needed to work on the engine
of the Entelect Challenge in 2019 (the year in which I'm writing this!

** Emacs Jupyter
So I'm starting a data science and ML course to get up to speed with

** Python
I've been making various customisations to my Python setup as I do

** C++
I haven't written c++ in a while.  I figure, though, that it's an
important skill to keep sharp.  So I'm creating a basic configuration

** Ruby
I occasionally edit ruby files.  More recently I've done this in the
context of modifying Chef scripts.  I'd like to make sure that my Ruby
setup is adequate and that my skills are sharp so I'll do problems in

** R
R is a programming language which targets the audience of Scientists
and Engineers who are interested in statistics and data modelling.

The most popular way to view and edit R is to use the Emacs Speaks
Statistics (ESS) package.

** GNUs
GNUs is a news reader and mail client.  It has a very minimalist
interface but is gigantic in it's scope.  Right now I'm only beginning
my adventure into this incredibly cool mode, as I go I'll keep this
updated with what I find.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref gnus :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-gnus-summary-toggle-header ()

** E Reader
Unfortunately I don't have a program installed for reading e-books.
There's an Emacs package which does do it though so I'm going to give
it a bash and see if it can provide the 99% of what I need.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref e-reader none :lexical t
  (use-package ereader
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** CSV Data
A lot of data is distributed as CSV because it's a universal format
and it's very easy to parse.  However, viewing a CSV file can be
difficult because the data can easily span multiple lines with
wrapping and it can also be difficult to extract and work with data in
the file.

CSV mode provides facilities to align and manipulate data stored in
CSV files.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref csv :lexical t
  (use-package csv-mode
      :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** iBuffer Mode
iBuffer is a built in package in emacs which makes controlling buffers
more powerful.  It provides a dired like interface with advanced
filtering features for dealing with types of buffers in bulk.

I've added some configuration to make the names column wider and group
buffers by projectile project.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref ibuffer :lexical t
  (require 'ibuffer)

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-b") 'ibuffer)
  (autoload 'ibuffer "ibuffer" "List buffers." t)

  (setq ibuffer-formats
        '((mark modified read-only " "
           (name 35 35 :left :elide) ; change: 30s were originally 18s
           " "
           (size 9 -1 :right)
           " "
           (mode 16 16 :left :elide)
           " " filename-and-process)
          (mark " "
           (name 16 -1)
           " " filename)))
#+END_SRC

** Bufler
I recently came across a command for switching between and organising
buffers which automatically groups buffers together.  It's written by
the same guy who wrote ~prism~.  I'm going to use it for switching
buffers, because I think that it could be helpful when working with
multiple projects.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref bufler :lexical t
  (use-package bufler
    :ensure t
    :config (progn
              (setq bufler-face-prefix "prism-level-")))
#+END_SRC

** iSearchb
iSearchB is a built in package which is like isearch, in that it's
interactive, but it searches through your buffer list.

Q: How is this different from any of the other methods of switching
buffers?

A: It shows the target buffer as you're typing!

e.g. Suppose that you want to switch to *Help* and you have buffers
named:
 - have-a-nice-day.el
 - its-heavy.txt
 - \*Help\*
open.

When you activate iSearchb and type "h" the best match is the first
buffer, have-a-nice-day.el.  It will immediately show you the contents
of that buffer.  If you then type "e" it matches the second buffer
its-heavy.txt, which is then shown.  Finally if you type the "l" it
only matches the \*Help\* buffer so it shows that.  At any point you
can hit a movement key and it'll stay on that buffer -- totally
awesome!!!  I've bound it to =C-z=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref isearchb :lexical t
  (define-key global-map [(control ?z)] 'isearchb-activate)
#+END_SRC

** Markdown
A lot of online manuals and media is written in markdown because if
it's brief and easy to read syntax without marking up the source to a
published format.  It's a lot like org-mode, but doesn't include nearly
as many features.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref markdown :lexical t
  (use-package markdown-mode
      :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** Dired Mode
Emacs has a powerful model for editing directories and files which
presents files to the user in an interactive view which looks like an
=ls -lh= interface.  The idea comes from an old program which I believe
was installed on IBM computers.  The idea is that one can select
navigate and perform file-systemish tasks on the files such as copying
and altering privileges of files and directories.

In this view I prefer that I can't see executable files and object
files, because I'll never have to open them or move them about and if
I want to delete them I can just use a glob pattern in eshell or
=M-x delete-file=.

NOTE: It looks like the config. to exclude certain files has gone
missing :/

I can also tweak a few of the settings in plain old vanilla dired mode
such as a setting which sets the default destination buffer when you
copy files.

There is a list of dired hacks which adds some totally cool features
to dired.  The first of these that I'm trying out is a feature which
makes the sub directory opening more like a tree view.

** EWW
Emacs now comes with a web browser! =:D= I use it to create system
specific tasks and to browse things on the net without leaving
Emacs.  In that way it helps me be more productive by not context
switching or being distracted by adds and animation.

Note: this section was heavily modified and the flow might not make a
whole lot of sense anymore.  I've aggregated all of the code blocks
which used to be here into one included file.

Org mode is a system which supports structured note taking, document
typesetting, organisation and literate programming.  It's what I've
used to put this literate program together.  I use org mode to organise
my work and keep track of what I do.  Part of that is staging tasks and
keeping track of the state that they're in.  I've added ``NEXT'',
``STARTED'' and ``SUSPENDED'' as keywords to represent important
intermediary steps in my work flow so that I can better track my progress.

In org mode you can have several files which Emacs will load when you
ask for an agenda through org mode.  Because these will be at different
locations depending on the projects being worked on, on a particular
computer, we require for the list of agenda files to be loaded
separately for this configuration not to break when deployed.

Org mode is capable of exporting to many formats.  What I've found
using the HTML exporter is that images can be very poorly rendered in
terms of their width.  I got the following snippet from an [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11670654/how-to-resize-images-in-org-mode][SO article]]
to allow for image widths to be set, e.g.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+ATTR_HTML: width="100px"
[[~/images/example.jpg]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

I like writing technical specifications in org mode.  I use plant UML
to generate UML diagrams from text based specifications.  This is
especially nifty because I can write the entire darn thing in org
(plain text!) and have it exported to various formats including
diagrams of the system and it's functionality.

Finally when writing literate programs and other documents which
include source code, it's useful to have org apply the correct font
lock to the code both for editing and for exporting.  Org fontify
natively does this in org file that you're editing and the LaTeX
options ensure that listings is used when exporting to PDF via LaTeX.

The "o" template for agenda views comes from
https://github.com/psamim/dotfiles.  psamim designed a very minimal
and clean UI using icons and I adapted it to my workflow.

Howard Abrams posted a how to on using org mode for literate dev ops.
It's amazingly cool.  Some of the best features I learned about
include the ability to set a property for all of the code blocks under
the current heading with a =:PROPERTY:= drawer.

*** Appearance
Other than the cool stuff which Howard used to accelerate dev ops. he
also had a pretty cool setup for his org mode.  I'm going to try out
two of his suggestions: Large Headings instead of plain text in other
colours and picture bullets instead of many stars.

Org bullets is available from MELPA.  I actually wrote a snippet here
to help write activation hook functions in Emacs Lisp.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref org-bullets :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-activate-org-bullets-mode ()
    (when (null quiescent-starting-up)
      (org-bullets-mode 1)))

  (use-package org-bullets
    :ensure t
    :config (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'quiescent-activate-org-bullets-mode))
#+END_SRC

=org-beautify-theme= makes all of the headings larger.  It's a theme
so all that's needed is to load it.  This looks awesome and actually
corrected some of the things which I didn't like about =zerodark= in
org mode (such as the weird colour for special block separators).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref org-beautify-theme :lexical t
  (use-package org-beautify-theme
      :ensure t
      :defer
      :init (when (null (getenv "VIRTUAL_TERMINAL"))
              (load-theme 'org-beautify)))
#+END_SRC

*** Cool Stuff in Howard's Demo
Howard showed an example of running a command on a remote server by
setting the =dir= to a remote directory (adding a property is bound to
=C-c C-x p= and removing a property is bound to =C-c C-x d=):

#+BEGIN_SRC org :lexical t :tangle no
  ,* Install Python Server
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DIR:      /minecraft.howardabrams.com
    :END:

  Here we get the host name from the remote server.  It runs on the
  remote server because we set the =dir= property for all code blocks.

  ,#+BEGIN_SRC sh :lexical t
    hostname --long
  ,#+END_SRC

  Here is the list of currently installed, python-related packages on
  the server:

  ,#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results table :post column1(data=*this*) :lexical t
    sude dpjg --get-selections | grep -v deistall | egrep -i '^python\b'
  ,#+END_SRC

  But the problem with these results is that they're poorly formatted.
  We'll use some =Elisp= to fix it!

  ,#+NAME: column1
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data="" :results value :lexical t
    (mapcar #'car data)
  ,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

Having shown us this awesomeness he then goes on to describe a way of
creating a library from these helper functions which you define in
your org files.  The feature is called "tower-of-babel".  In a tower
file you can specify (in a literate program) helper functions which
you can use elsewhere.

You can add a file to your tower of babel with =C-c C-v i=.

You can also use a persistent session to a server to eliminate the
overhead of always connecting.  This is done with a =:session:=
property which can, again, be set as a property.  You can view the
session itself by switching to the buffer by that name.

The final thing he shows is how to use multiple hops in the connection
for TRAMP.  Here's the syntax:

=/ssh:<first-host>|<second-host>|<dest-host>:<path-to-file>=

*** Enforcing Dependencies
It's possible to get org mode to prevent you from working on things
down the line first.  All that you have to do is add the property
=:ORDERED= as =t= to a parent task and it will force the sub tasks to
be ordered.  To add a property to a sub tree all you need is: =M-x
org-property-action=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref org-dependencies :lexical t
  (setq org-enforce-todo-dependencies t)
#+END_SRC

*** Reveal
You can export org documents to RevealJS presentations.  It's a very
simple way of doing things but it lets you be productive.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref org-reveal :lexical t
  (use-package ox-reveal
      :ensure t
      :demand t)

  (require 'url)

  (defun quiescent-download-reveal-js-here ()
    "Download the reveal source file here."
    (interactive)
    (progn
      (url-copy-file "https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/archive/3.9.2.tar.gz" "reveal.js-3.9.2.tar.gz")
      (shell-command "tar -xzvf reveal.js-3.9.2.tar.gz")
      (shell-command "mv reveal.js-3.9.2/ reveal.js")))
#+END_SRC

*** Secretaria
There's a package on Melpa which aims to help you keep track of what
you're doing.  It does so by reminding you of your clocked in task and
saving your clocked in task so that it can let you know about it when
you restart Emacs.  I think that it'll help me to keep track of
things.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref secretaria :lexical t
  (use-package secretaria
    :ensure t)
#+end_src

*** Org Brain
There's an interesting approach to note taking and exploration which
uses implicit edges between nodes in a hierarchy to create an
explore-able web of information.  "The Brain" was the first piece of
software to implement the idea.  Org Brain is Emacs' equivalent of
that software.  I'm going to give it a go as a story mind-mapping
tool.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref org-brain :lexical t
  (use-package org-brain
    :ensure t
    :init
    (setq org-brain-path "~/org/brain")
    :config
    (bind-key "C-c b" 'org-brain-prefix-map org-mode-map)
    (setq org-id-track-globally t)
    (setq org-id-locations-file "~/.emacs.d/.org-id-locations")
    (add-hook 'before-save-hook #'org-brain-ensure-ids-in-buffer)
    (push '("b" "Brain" plain (function org-brain-goto-end)
            "* %i%?" :empty-lines 1)
          org-capture-templates)
    (setq org-brain-visualize-default-choices 'all)
    (setq org-brain-title-max-length 12)
    (setq org-brain-include-file-entries nil
          org-brain-file-entries-use-title nil))
#+end_src


** Htmlize
Org mode can export to HTML with source code highlighting.  You need
the Htmlize package to do it though.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref htmlize :lexical t
  (use-package htmlize
      :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** EPresent
Epresent is a mode designed to enable presentations to be given from
org mode files.  The idea is that you simply open an org file and call
Epresent.  There are built in bindings to do the following (from the
github README):

 - Call epresent-run on an org-buffer.
 - press t / 1 to view the top level of the presentation
 - navigate the presentation with n/f, p/b
 - scroll with k and l
 - use c and C to navigate between code blocks, e to edit them, x to
   make it run, and s / S to toggle their visibility
 - quit with q

I've decided to use it for a lightning talk I'm giving on Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref epresent :lexical t
  (use-package epresent
   :ensure t)

  (defun outline-hide-body ()
    "I think that epresent expects this function to be here.

  I suspect that it was part of old org mode."
    (hide-body))

  (defface epresent-date-face
    '((t :weight bold :height 270 :underline t :inherit variable-pitch))
    "I think that epresent also expects this face to be there."
    :group  'epresent)

  (defun quiescent-epresent-toggle-hide-src-blocks ()
    "Run `epresent-toggle-hide-src-blocks'."
    (when (null quiescent-starting-up)
      (epresent-toggle-hide-src-blocks)))

  (add-hook 'epresent-mode-hook
         #'quiescent-epresent-toggle-hide-src-blocks)

  (when quiescent-macbook
    (advice-add 'epresent-quit :around
          #'quiescent-inhibit-frame-deletion))
#+END_SRC

** Demo IT
I recently decided that demos of code are far to difficult to get
right every time and that there must be a better way.  Also I saw
Howard Abrams doing demos of code with style so I investigated and
discovered that he wrote a package for automating this kind of thing.

It's called "Demo It" and the idea is that one should be able to
script the steps of a demo and then just hit space a whole bunch of
times and step through code writing itself alongside a nice org
document.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref demo-it :lexical t
  (use-package demo-it
   :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

Demo it needs org-tree-slide in order to make your demonstration flick
between slides in the org buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref org-tree-slide :lexical t
  (use-package org-tree-slide
   :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** Magit Mode
Magit is a system which integrates tightly with Git and the built in
VC commands of Emacs to provide a super cool interface to using Git
for version control.

I had to force magit to ask for passwords using an environment
variable so that I could connect to repositories over HTTPS.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref magit-setup :lexical t
  (use-package magit
      :ensure t
      :config
      (progn
        (setenv "GIT_ASKPASS" "git-gui--askpass")
        (global-set-key (kbd "C-c m") #'magit-status)))
#+END_SRC

I often create commit messages which note the change per file.
Instead of writing it out every time I'm creating a hook to add it in.
It turns out that the Magit editor pops up asynchronously.  This is a
problem for me because there's no hook either and it runs text mode
:/.  Instead I've made this command interactive.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref magit-insert-files :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-insert-files-for-commit-message (&rest _)
    "Insert the files in the changes to be commited section of the magit commit message buffer."
    (interactive)
    (progn
      (insert "\n\n")
      (while (quiescent-copy-next-file-to-here)
        (insert "\n"))
      (goto-char (point-min))))

  (defun quiescent-copy-next-file-to-here ()
    "Copy the next file in changes to be committed to point."
    (let (found-it)
      (save-excursion
        (when (re-search-forward "modified: +src/")
          (when (save-excursion
                  (not (ignore-errors
                         (re-search-backward "Changes not staged for commit:"))))
            (backward-word)
            (kill-line)
            (setq found-it t))))
      (yank)
      found-it))
#+END_SRC

** Git Commands
I've added a few commands which I intend to use in eshell to make
things a bit easier.  I'll alias them as I go.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref git-commands :lexical t
  (require 'quiescent/git)
#+END_SRC

** Chess
I downloaded and setup a chess mode for fun and for passing time while
waiting for things which are blocking me.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref chess :lexical t
  (use-package chess
      :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** Typing Game
This is quite cool.  There's a typing game on the EMACS package
archives which is inspired by typing of the dead.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref typing-game :lexical t
  (use-package typing
      :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** Slock
Slock is a program which will lock the screen.  You just need to enter
your password to unlock it.  While it's locked it'll show plain
colours on your screens.  Since I'm using Emacs as my window manager
at work I'll need to be able to lock my PC from Emacs so I'm going to
create a command to do that.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref slock :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-lock-pc ()
    "Lock this computer.

  Enter the password for this account to unlock it."
    (interactive)
    (start-process "slock" "*slock-buffer*" "slock"))
#+END_SRC

** Tramp
Tramp is a system which allows Emacs to behave as though it were
running on a remote system.  It makes working on remote servers
amazing because you can edit files with local latency and then
synchronise them back to the server when you're ready.

Tramp has built in support for most network protocols.  I recently
discovered that it also has support for connecting to Docker.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref tramp :lexical t
  (use-package docker-tramp
      :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** Gnu Plot
Emacs can drive gnuplot and this functionality can be integrated to
org mode :) I'm using it to do plots in academic documents right now
but the possibilities are limitless.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref gnuplot :lexical t
  (use-package gnuplot
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** 4Clojure
4Clojure is a website which provides challenges for hackers who want
to practice programming in Clojure.  Incidentally there's an Emacs
client for that ;)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref 4clojure :lexical t
  (use-package 4clojure
    :ensure t)

  <<4clojure-convenience>>
  <<track-4clojure-progress>>
  <<4clojure-correct-number>>
  <<4clojure-pickup>>
#+END_SRC

After trying one out I was alarmed to find that the this package
doesn't help you to track progress and that you have to M-x all the
things to get the questions answered and move onto the next question.

Artur Malabarba to the rescue!  The following makes answering
questions with this interface much more convenient.  Now I can answer
the question at the end of the buffer and hit M-j to answer and
progress.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref 4clojure-convenience :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-backward-up-list-w/o-errors ()
    "Move backward up list once without errors."
    (condition-case nil
        (progn
          (backward-up-list)
          t)
      (error nil)))

  (defun quiescent-escape-all-sexps ()
    "Move the point up out of every sexp until it's not contained by any."
    (interactive)
    (while (quiescent-backward-up-list-w/o-errors)))

  (defun endless/4clojure-check-and-proceed (&rest _)
    "Check the answer and show the next question if it worked."
    (interactive)
    (if
        (save-excursion
          ;; Find last sexp (the answer).
          (goto-char (point-min))
          (while (search-forward "__" nil t))
          (quiescent-escape-all-sexps)
          (forward-list)
          ;; Check the answer.
          (let ((answer
                 (buffer-substring (point) (point-max)))
                ;; Preserve buffer contents, in case you failed.
                (orig-buffer (buffer-string)))
            (goto-char (point-min))
            (while (search-forward "__" nil t)
              (when (not (quiescent-inside-comment-p))
                (replace-match answer)))
            (prog1
                (string-match "failed." (4clojure-check-answers))
              (erase-buffer)
              (insert orig-buffer))))
        (message "Failed :(")
      (4clojure-next-question)))

  (defun endless-4clojure-new-problem (&rest _)
    (progn
      ;; Prettify the 4clojure buffer.
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (forward-line 2)
      (forward-char 3)
      (fill-paragraph)
      ;; Position point for the answer
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (insert "\n\n\n")
      (forward-char -1)
      ;; Define our key.
      (local-set-key (kbd "M-j") #'endless/4clojure-check-and-proceed)))

  (advice-add #'4clojure/start-new-problem :after #'endless-4clojure-new-problem)
  (advice-add #'endless/4clojure-check-and-proceed :before #'save-some-buffers)
#+END_SRC

There's only one piece of the puzzle missing though, because I don't
have a way of tracking progress with this.  So, how about adding
advice to the advice which saves the current buffer to a configurable
answers directory (!)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref track-4clojure-progress :lexical t
  (defvar quiescent-4clojure-answer-directory "~/.emacs.d/4clojure-answers/"
    "A directory where the answers to 4clojure questions should be answered.")

  (defun quiescent-4clojure-save-answer (&rest _)
    "Save the current buffer as a solution to a 4clojure problem."
    (write-file (replace-regexp-in-string
                 "\\*" ""
                 (concat quiescent-4clojure-answer-directory (buffer-name) ".clj"))))

  (advice-add #'4clojure/start-new-problem :after #'quiescent-4clojure-save-answer)
#+END_SRC

One last problem is that the 4clojure library uses the buffer name to
figure out what question you're answering.  The number is used to make
a REST call to check the answer.  I'll have to modify that to work
with my changes to the buffer name.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref 4clojure-correct-number :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-4clojure-problem-number-from-name (buffer-name)
    "Produce the problem number part of BUFFER-NAME."
    (string-to-number
     (car
      (last
       (split-string
        (file-name-sans-extension
         (file-name-nondirectory
          buffer-name))
        "-")))))

  (defun 4clojure/problem-number-of-current-buffer ()
    "Gets the problem number of the current buffer or 0 if current buffer isn't
  named something like *blah-blah-123*"
    (quiescent-4clojure-problem-number-from-name (buffer-name (current-buffer))))
#+END_SRC

Another feature which I'm interested in having here is being able to
pick up where I left off from.  All I need to do is find the latest
question answered in the question answers directory and add one to the
question number!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref 4clojure-pickup :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-4clojure-problems-done ()
    "Produce a list of the problem numbers which I've completed on 4clojure."
    (mapcar (lambda (file-name) (quiescent-4clojure-problem-number-from-name file-name))
            (directory-files quiescent-4clojure-answer-directory nil nil t)))

  (defun quiescent-4clojure-max-problem-number ()
    "Produce the highest problem number I've solved in 4clojure."
    (apply #'max (quiescent-4clojure-problems-done)))

  (defun quiescent-4clojure-pickup ()
    (interactive)
    "Pickup from where I left off with 4clojure problems."
    (4clojure-open-question (number-to-string (1+ (quiescent-4clojure-max-problem-number)))))
#+END_SRC

This works, but there's a lot of noise when I solve one due to all the
moving around and marking which happens to isolate the solution.  The
solution to that is to suppress message while I'm finding the
solution.  I should also make the buffers save without user input,
because that's a bit irritating atm.

** ERC
Emacs comes with it's own IRC client which is pretty darn good and
gets updates all of the time.  I'm going to see whether I can use it
to connect to the Clojure channel on zatech.slack.com.  I actually
don't think that I'll need any config to get started with this so here
goes!  (=M-x erc=)

** BBDB
BBDB is the Big Brother insidious DataBase for Emacs.  It's a database
of contact details which people mostly use for storing and auto
completing email addresses in an email client.

I decided to start using it because I always have to look up email
addresses and that's a bit of a pain and a bit of an embarrassment
given the level of Emacs Fu to which I claimed to have reached.  So
here goes.  I chose the very first link which Google spat out at me
and followed the guidance of some unknown soul on the Internet.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref bbdb :lexical t

** Rest Client
Emacs has a rest client.  I'm going to be working with micro services

Emacs and potentially even share them with my team (!)

** Linkd
I recently came across =highlight.el= and found that it uses

RET= and find the entry on highlight.

** CalcTex
[[Github.com]] recently added a feature (or they always had it and I had
no idea) where you it shows you repositories which you might be
interested in.  Recently it pointed me at some Emacs Lisp so naturally
I was very interested.  The repository was called CalcTex and it's
basically a WYSIWIG editor for LaTeX equations with built in support
for ~calc-mode~ which is the Emacs symbolic calculator.  I find this
idea very appealing so I'm adding it here with the intention of
showing it off to people soon.

Emacs can be used for much more than just writing code and interacting
with complicated Linux programs.  (It is afterall an *editor*.)  One
of Emacs's strengths is writing documents and markup languages for
natural language.

** iA Writer Mode
iA writer is an editor for writers to get a distraction-free writing
experience.  It looks great, to be honest, and a bunch of people have
made modifications to their Emacs to be more like the it.  I'm
creating a minor mode to replicate their work in Emacs and then I'm
going to build up on it.

** LaTeX
Prof. Gibbon (AKA comrade Gibbon.) descriptions of electrons as sheep
and controversial discussions of politics, religion and all other
things designed to get fresh first years thinking about the world made
him well known among the EE Students at Wits.  One principle that he
taught his students and which resonated with me is to "arrive never,
rather than late."  Another is (which I'm very happy about) is LaTeX.

Apparently named after a German tank, this typesetting language makes
Microsoft Word look like a child's play thing.  Gone are the missing
features and the incorrectly typeset pages.  Gone are the images which
just don't go in the right place and the endless context menus where
you just can't find what you were looking for...  =:)=

I like to use custom stuff in my LaTeX files, like non standard
fonts.  This requires that either XeTeX or LuaTeX be used instead of
pdfTeX.  I chose LuaTeX a while ago and I've kinda stuck with it.

The best mode for editing LaTeX files in Emacs is AucTeX.  Aside from
changing the font lock settings does a number of other things to
integrate more tightly with LaTeX.  It doesn't provide itself so
instead I check whether it installed first and then install it if it's
not installed.

** Fly Spell
Emacs comes with an interactive spell checking system called
Flyspell.  I've chosen to enable it in Bibtex, text and TeX/LaTeX
modes.  I usually use aspell as the local system binary for performing
the actual spell checks and use the standard British dictionary.

** Langtool
I recently found a tool online which allows one to perform grammar
checking.  The commands for invoking it can be found at the prefix
=langtool-=.  It's designed to be used non-interactively, so I should

#+END_SRC

** PDF Tools
Emacs has built in support for pre-rendering a PDF document and then
displaying images corresponding to the pages of the PDF in a buffer.
This approach leaves a bit to be desired.  It's a bit slow, the
quality of the rendered PDF isn't all that great and it's just an
image.  It not being an image is a problem because you can't isearch
through an image.  It's for these reasons that I usually don't view
PDFs in Emacs.

Recently, though, Henry made me aware of a package called PDF tools.
It's great because it renders the pages of a PDF on demand and
supports richer features.  Such as searching, occur and more.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref pdf-tools :lexical t

#+END_SRC

** Editing Writing
I often switch between writing a story and then editing it with
Grammarly.  When I write stories in Emacs then I like to keep the
paragraphs formatted to the built in width rules with
~fill-paragraph~, and when I switch across to Grammarly it likes the
paragraphs to be written in the more modern style: where line breaks
are only used in between paragraphs.

I've written to functions which enable you to go to and from those
formats as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref fill-unfill-paragraph :lexical t
  (defmacro quiescent-for-all-paragraphs (&rest body)
    "Execute BODY with the point in each paragraph in the current buffer."
    `(save-excursion
       (goto-char (point-min))
       (while (not (eq (point) (point-max)))
         (ignore-errors
           ,@body
           (forward-paragraph)))))

  (defun quiescent-fill-all-paragraphs ()
    "Run `fill-paragraph' on all paragraphs in the current document."
    (interactive)
    (quiescent-for-all-paragraphs (fill-paragraph)))

  (defun quiescent-unfill-all-paragraphs ()
    "Run `unfill-paragraph' on all paragraphs in the current document."
    (interactive)
    (quiescent-for-all-paragraphs (unfill-paragraph)))

* Controlling Emacs
These are the bindings which I've added to make working with Emacs,
it's frames and it's windows faster.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref controlling-emacs :lexical t
  (defun quiescent-close-help ()
    "Close the help window."
    (interactive)
    (let ((original-window (selected-window)))
      (cl-loop
         for window being the windows
         when (equal "*Help*" (buffer-name (window-buffer window)))
           do (select-window window)
              (call-interactively #'quit-window))
      (select-window original-window)))

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c f") #'make-frame)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c B") #'browse-url-at-point)
  (global-set-key (kbd "s-o")   #'other-frame)
  (global-set-key (kbd "s-q")   #'quiescent-close-help)

  (key-chord-define-global "x0" #'delete-window)
  (key-chord-define-global "x1" #'delete-other-windows)
  (key-chord-define-global "x2" #'split-window-below)
  (key-chord-define-global "x3" #'split-window-right)

Emacs is controllable via the same system of key bindings as is used
for programing etc.  For instance you can split windows, create new
frames, fullscreen etc.

#+END_SRC

Because Emacs is extensible it's possible to extend the features of
the editor and the Emacs Lisp language.  In this section we list such
modifications.

** Async
Some of the things that I've been hacking into Emacs lately take a lot
of time to process.  I can't have these blocking the main thread
because that would prevent me from getting on with stuff.

The first code I've written which requires this is my function to
parse the whole of a project.  This takes ages but will help me to
speed up my interaction with large projects.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref async :lexical t
  (use-package async
      :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** GCMH
The Garbage Collector Magic Hack is to try to only do garbage
collection while the system is idle.  If you can manage this then
longer running tasks will run with far less garbage collection.  Since
user interaction is the main axis of computation in Emacs it seems
reasonable that this will just be a good improvement overall.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref gcmh :lexical t
  (use-package gcmh

#+END_SRC

Emacs has support for themes.  One may design a theme and have it
loaded to change the look and feel of Emacs.  I discovered the Ample
theme on the Melpa repository and I think it's pretty cool.  I'm a fan
of having a dark background so I enabled the dark theme.

Since writing this paragraph I've switched from Ample to Zerodark (by
Peton) and then to Doom-Themes.  Doom Themes are the best designed
themes I've used.  They have great coverage of Emacs features, a great
mode line and they're reasonably efficient.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref themes :lexical t

There's another thing that you can do about nested blocks: you can

Line feed is a common feature of lisp code and EMACS outputs from
terminals and compilation buffers.  By default they render as =^L= but
I read about a package which renders them as lines across the screen
as if they are actually breaking the page.  That's pretty darn cool, so
I decided to use the package myself.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref page-break-lines :lexical t

Another cool thing that I actually added and then forgot about is
prettify symbols mode.  It allows for common constructs in various
modes to be swapped out for things which look better when viewing
them.  For instance when editing an Emacs Lisp buffer it might be
convenient to view a lambda as the actual Greek character (that's one
of the defaults which the mode has built in.)

I want to get straight down to business when I open EMACS!

  (setq inhibit-splash-screen t)
#+END_SRC

** Mb-depth
I'm starting to get into recursive editing, especially with icicles;
which is partially premised on it.  mb-depth gives a visual indication
of the depth of the minibuffer so that you can tell just how deep down
the rabbit hole you've gone.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref mb-depth :lexical t
  (use-package mb-depth
      :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** Agenda Margins
I'm paying a bit more attention to the presentation of my agenda
because I want it to feel less cluttered.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref agenda-margins :lexical t
  (defvar quiescent-org-agenda-visible-width 128
    "The width of the visible portion of the org agenda buffer.")

  (defun quiescent-setup-agenda-margins ()
    "Compute the margins for the agenda buffer and make it so."
    (dolist (window (window-list))
      (when (string-equal "*Org Agenda*" (buffer-name (window-buffer window)))
       (let ((margin-width (round (max 0 (/ (- (window-width) quiescent-org-agenda-visible-width) 2)))))
         (set-window-margins window margin-width margin-width)))))

  (defun quiescent-reset-margins (&rest _)
    "Reset the margins on all windows to nil."
    (dolist (window (window-list))
      (unless (string-equal "*Org Agenda*" (buffer-name (window-buffer window)))
        (set-window-margins window 0 0))))

* Conclusion
EMACS has become a part of my life.  It's had a profound effect on the
way that I think about doing my work and without it I would be a far
worse typist and programmer altogether.  I credit it with a large part
of my ability to deliver on projects and continue to pick up new
programming languages fast.

It has also shaped my philosophy on how good code should be written.
That is, not by blindly following the suggestions which an IDE makes
to me, but by understanding what I'm writing before I do it and then
using the best tools for fast insertion and navigation to make it a
reality.  This is a hallmark of how I work and I'd like to think that
it's one of the biggest things which sets me aside from other
developers.
